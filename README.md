# 11011482

## DESCRIPTION

Expo CLI was used to construct this React Native blank template project. The app shows a name that is bolded in a basic text message.
The Task was to use Expo CLI to build a new React Native blank template project and edit the App.js file with the following modifications:

* Edit the View component's background color.
* Edit the Text so that "My name is YourName" appears.
* Make the text's font size larger to 24.
* Put "YourName" in bold type; for example, if your name is John, it should read "My name is John".
